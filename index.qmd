# Welcome to my website!

I am You Yun, a penultimate Economics and Data Science undergraduate student at the Singapore Management University. This website serves to offer a glimpse into the projects I have been working on (including some coursework and personal projects).

For instance, some course work I have included in the site includes my work from Geospatial Analytics and Statistical Learning with R. A separate site has been created for [Geospatial Analytics](https://youyunpeng-is415.netlify.app/) as part of the coursework, if you would like to explore further. Beyond my coursework, I am trying to work on learning other methods of analysis on my own, including text analytics and machine learning methods. Most of the data used is publicly sourced, and I invite you to try out some of the projects stated in the website along with me!

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:youyun.peng.2021@smu.edu.sg) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
