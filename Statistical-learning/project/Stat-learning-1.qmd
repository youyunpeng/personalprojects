# Project Outline

In this project, we were given data on resale prices of HDB flats in Punggol. The project task was to create the best explanatory regression that can best explain variation in prices. The independent regressors and dependent variable in the regression are as such:

+--------------------+---------------------------+
| Dependent Variable | Independent regressors    |
+====================+===========================+
| Resale price       | Date of sale              |
|                    |                           |
|                    | Type of room              |
|                    |                           |
|                    | Block number              |
|                    |                           |
|                    | Street                    |
|                    |                           |
|                    | Story                     |
|                    |                           |
|                    | Area                      |
|                    |                           |
|                    | Model                     |
|                    |                           |
|                    | Lease Begin Date          |
|                    |                           |

## Methodology
### Summary
We first conducted an analysis on the independent variable‚Äôs relationship with all dependent variable through a simple plot diagram. This allowed us to identify the class and magnitude of the variables that required data transformation. Following which, we did a pairs analysis of the independent variables to identify variables which have multicollinearity issues. Simple linear regression between the independent variables that showed relationship was done to confirm multicollinearity. Subsequently, individual regression between the dependent variable and multicollinear variables was performed to eliminate one of the 2 variables. Criteria for variable selection were statistical significance of the coefficients and their corresponding ùëÖ2 value.

### Data Wrangling
The data was cleaned and tidied to remove outliers and unnecessary levels, and to fit the variables into the appropriate data types.
Elimination of Potentially Severe Multicollinearity
Based on domain knowledge, we determined that a few variables were likely to exhibit severe multicollinearity issues. We verified these by conducting regression analysis and VIF analysis. We opted to drop the variables with weaker explanatory power to eliminate the problem of severe multicollinearity.

### Regression Modeling
We individually regress all selected independent variables against ResalePrice and discover that most categories are significant at the 1% level. This results in our preliminary model, M1. We then seek to improve this base case by considering higher order and interaction effects.

### Higher Order Effects and Interaction Terms
In a preliminary assessment of the relationship between residuals and variables, we suspected potential heteroskedasticity of the numeric variable Area. Hence, we investigated if there were higher order effects present. However, we did not find any significant relationship from higher order effects of the variable Area.

To determine the interaction effects between independent variables, we first considered the relationships between Area and LeaseBegin against other variables based on domain knowledge. We conducted the search for interaction effects of Area and LeaseBegin on other variables by running marginally improved regressions and comparing with the best model on hand, mimicking a forward stepwise subset selection method. Our results show that the interaction of Area with LeaseBegin and Model, and interaction of LeaseBegin and Model provided the greatest decrease in BIC from our preliminary model. We then obtain our final regression model, inclusive of the relevant independent variables and interaction effects as mentioned.

### Assumption Checking and Residual Analysis
To check the validity of the regression model, we conducted a goodness-of-fit test on the residuals and conducted a residual analysis by plotting out the residuals against the variables used in the regression model. This was a preliminary test to check if any of the normality assumptions were violated. We proceeded to perform the Kolmogorov-Smimov (KS) test at 1% level of significance to confirm the normality of regression residuals.
